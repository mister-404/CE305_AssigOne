# How tools were applied

A list of tools that I used to complete this project were:-

| Tool                                      | Version                       | Why I used it                                                | Link to tool                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3.2 (Ultimate Edition) | 11.0.9.1+11-b1145.77 x86_64   | I used this as my IDE (Integrated Development Environment). It provides helpful tips to make editing plain text files painless. | https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/                    |
| openJDK 15                                | v15.0.2                       | Used to compile and debug my Java source code.<br /><br />I used this late version of the JDK (Java Development Kit) because I appreciate the simplified switch statements that aren't on offer in legacy JDK 8 versions. | https://jdk.java.net/15/                           |
| Mac mini 2018                             | Running macOS Big Sur v11.2.1 | This was the hardware and operating system that I used to develop and test the software that I produced.<br /><br />I appreciate the unix features that the system has making it very easy to use the command line to troubleshoot. | https://www.apple.com/uk/mac-mini/specs/           |
| ANTLR v4 Complete Jar                     | v4.9                          | Used to provide the generated ANTLR lexer and parser with common features needed in interpreters and compilers.<br /><br />For instance, a ParseTree is something that will apply to all generated ANTLR code and so is needed in a general sense. | https://www.antlr.org/download.html                |
| ANTLR v4 IntelliJ plugin                  | v1.16                         | Helped me understand in an interactive way whether the grammar I was producing was effective with the useful window at the bottom that allows you to type in an expression and see the tree.<br /><br />Also, through using this you can create the generated Java parser and lexer that follows the rules prescribed in the grammar. | https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7358-antlr-v4 |
| Typora                                    | v0.9.9.36.2                   | Used to create this report. It's a markdown editor which can then be used to export to pdf (as well as many other things). | http://typora.io                                   |
| git                                       | v2.24.0                       | Version control allowing me to swiftly program with the safe knowledge that my work is backed up if I need to revert back to previous versions. | https://git-scm.com/                               |
